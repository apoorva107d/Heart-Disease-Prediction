# **Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning**  

## **Overview**  
This project utilizes **Logistic Regression**, a machine learning algorithm, to predict the likelihood of **heart disease** based on medical data. By analyzing key health parameters, the model helps in early detection, allowing for timely medical intervention.  

## **Features**  
✅ Predicts heart disease risk based on patient data  
✅ Uses **Logistic Regression** for accurate classification  
✅ Trained on a structured dataset with medical attributes  
✅ Provides **real-time predictions** for individual cases  
✅ Achieves high accuracy on training and test data  

## **Dataset**  
The model is trained on a dataset containing key medical indicators such as:  
✔️ Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type  
✔️ Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Levels  
✔️ Fasting Blood Sugar, ECG Results  
✔️ Maximum Heart Rate, Exercise-Induced Angina  
✔️ ST Depression, ST Slope, Number of Major Vessels  

## **Working of the Model**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loads and cleans the dataset  
2. **Feature Selection**: Uses patient attributes for prediction  
3. **Model Training**: Logistic Regression is trained on labeled data  
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Accuracy is tested on unseen data  
5. **Prediction**: New patient data is analyzed for heart disease risk  

## **Prediction Example**  
The model takes in a **set of medical values** and predicts whether the individual is at risk.  
Example input:  
```
(62, 0, 0, 140, 268, 0, 0, 160, 0, 3.6, 0, 2, 2)
```
Output:  
```
The Person has Heart Disease
```

## **Conclusion**  
This heart disease prediction model provides a valuable **AI-powered decision support system** for healthcare professionals, helping in early detection and prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
